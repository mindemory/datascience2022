Use the ratings of the *other* 399 movies in the dataset to predict the ratings of each movie (that means youâ€™ll have to build 399 models for each of the 400 movies). For each of the 400 movies, find the movie that predicts ratings the best. Then report the average COD of those 400 simple linear regression models. Please include a histogram of these 400 COD values and a table with the 10 movies that are most easily predicted from the ratings of a single other movie and the 10 movies that are hardest to predictfrom the ratings of a single other movie (and their associated COD values, as well as which movie ratings are the best predictor, so this table should have 3 columns)."

For each of them, do a media split (now using the imputed data) of ratings to code movies above the median rating with the Y label 1 (= enjoyed) and movies below the median with the label 0 (= not enjoyed). For each of these movies, build a logistic regression model (using X to predict Y), show figures with the outcomes and report the betas as well as the AUC values.
